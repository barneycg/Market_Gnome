PHP
JAXL v3 : https://github.com/abhinavsingh/JAXL/tree/v3.x
Mysql DB with invTypes and mapDenormalize tables from the CCP DataDump.

Modify example_start_market to point to the full path of your app.
run start_market.sh every minute using a cronjob.

Use :
Start a chat with your Market Bot JID and send him ItemName$SystemName and He'll send you back the Lowest Sell price of that Item in that System according to eve-marketdata. ;)

Get a region wide price using : ItemName$R$SystemName

A price of 0.00 probably means there are no sell orders (at least that have been uploaded to Eve-marketdata).

NB: Prices are only as accurate as the information in eve-marketdata.
